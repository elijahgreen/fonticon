# Contributing

To contribute fork the repository and execute

```shell
git clone <YOUR_FORK>
cd fonticon
npm install
# Install pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting (requires python to be installed).
npm run pre-commit
```

This installs all the necessary dependencies. Now you can build the code by running:

```shell
npm run build
```

Afterwards the `index.html` and other static assets can be found in the `dist` directory.

Alternatively, you can run:

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

This will start a [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server). While the server is running you can go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) where all your changes will be reflected as soon as you save a file.

During your commit, all changed code will be formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) so no need to worry about formatting ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ‰.
